## Building a Data Model
- Drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then figuring out how to represent the objects and their relationships
- Basic Rule: **Don't put the same string data in twice** - use a relationship instead
- When there is **one thing in the "real world,"** there **should only be one copy** of that thing in the database.

### For each "piece of info"...
- Is the column an object or an attribute of another object?
- Once we define objects, we need to define the relationships between objects.
